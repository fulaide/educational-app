## üìù Notes & Decisions

### Technical Decisions Made
- ‚úÖ **Svelte 5 Runes**: Using new reactivity system instead of stores
- ‚úÖ **Capacitor First**: Mobile-first approach with future Tauri support
- ‚úÖ **Static Adapter**: For mobile deployment compatibility
- ‚úÖ **JWT Strategy**: For stateless authentication
- ‚úÖ **UUID Students**: COPPA-compliant anonymous authentication

### Next Priority Tasks
1. **Complete shared UI package** - Foundation for all apps
2. **Set up Auth.js** - Critical for user management
3. **Database migrations** - Get database running
4. **Basic student UUID auth** - Core functionality
5. **QR code system** - Essential for student login

### Blocked/Waiting Items
- Mobile testing (requires physical devices or simulators)
- Payment integration (requires Paddle account setup)
- Email notifications (requires email service setup)
